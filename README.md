# r2hk
romaji to hiragana & katakana converter. first python script i ever made, it even comes with a silly gui!

romaji is converted to hiragana by default. for converting to katakana, put asterisks around the text you want to be katakana. (ex: *basubalu* desu! -> バスバウです！)

uncomment everything in the script for dark theme!

r2hk.py is what you should use. r2h.py and r2h_old.py is archived, you shouldn't use them!
